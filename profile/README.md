## Hi there 👋

CSIDS (pronounced SEE-sids) is a group of researchers who are dedicated to improving the quality of statistics used in modern day disease surveillance.

The founding members were responsible for developing and running the Norwegian Institute of Public Health’s automated surveillance platform (Sykdomspulsen) during the first three years of the COVID-19 pandemic.
